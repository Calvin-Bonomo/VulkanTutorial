# VulkanTutorial

A Vulkan renderer following the tutorial at [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Introduction) with some modifications to the coding style for legibility. I started this project in order to learn about Vulkan and modern 3D rendering technques and APIs.

## Future Considerations
- Use smartpointers instead of raw pointers.
- Move the renderer into another class, App should just be asking the renderer to draw stuff.
- Extend for use with Direct3D and/or OpenGL.
- Please for the love of god document this.
